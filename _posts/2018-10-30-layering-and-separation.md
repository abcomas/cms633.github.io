Tufte's main point in this chapter is that layers of information in designs need to have a certain degree of separation and communication between each other to cleanly present the data. Clustering and boldening can remove emphasis from the main argument of the design and so an approach that focuses the reader on the relevant information is essential for these models. He argues that failure to do this lead to cluttered and incoherent displays filled with disinformation, which will visually distract the user.
