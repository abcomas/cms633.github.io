It seems that the disadvantage of using GIS in the context of the reading is that it it ignores the relations that take place in mapped places. It is purely technical with its data and so poses a challenge when trying to use the technology with the humanities. Also, it can be expensive and hard to learn, both crucial aspects that can drive people away from using it. In terms of advantages, it provides useful data that if used properly and extrapolated, can answer many fundamental questions about the area in question.
